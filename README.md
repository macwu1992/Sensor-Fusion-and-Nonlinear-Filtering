## Final Assignment: Orientation estimation of a cellphone using EKF and Sensor Fusion

In this project accelerometer, magnetometer and gyroscope measurements were used in a sensor fusion fashion to estimate the orientation of a cellphone.

This project includes:
- Derivation of the motion model using quaternions representation
- Derivation of measurement models
- Implementation of EKF subject to outlier rejection and sensor failure
- Detailed analysis of the implemented EKF 


## Assignment 1: Gaussian distribution analysis

- Transformation of Gaussian random variables
- Analysis of joint distribution and posterior densities
- MMSE and MAP estimates for Gaussian mixture posteriors


## Assingment 2: Linear Kalman filter analysis, Motion and Measurement models

- A first Kalman filter and its properties
- Study of different Motion and Measurement models
- Kalman filter and its tuning


## Assignment 3: Nonlinear Kalman filter models (EKF, UKF, CKF)

- Approximations of mean and covariance
- Non-linear Kalman filtering
- Tuning non-linear filters


## Assignment 4: Smoothing, Particle Filter and Localization

- Non-linear RTS smoothers
- Particle filters for linear and Gaussian systems
- Localization: bicycle tracking in a village using Particle Filters
